//! A note about serialization:
//!
//! You may serialize the signature however you'd like; it's just a fixed-length byte array.
//! We _would_ support `serde` but currently fixed-length arrays have terrible, quasi-non-existent
//! support.
//!
//! Related issues:
//!
//! - <https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/2120>
//! - <https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/1937>
//! - <https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/1272>
//!
//! If/when those are fixed, we should be able to (trivially) add `serde` support.
//! Otherwise, neither the length prefix imposed by `(de)serialize_bytes()` nor the
//! terrible compaction and optimization of `(de)serialize_tuple()` are acceptable.
