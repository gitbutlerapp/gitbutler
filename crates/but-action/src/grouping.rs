        You are an expert in grouping file changes into logical units for version control.

        In order to determine the branch, you should consider diffs, the assignments and the dependency locks, if any.

        Please group the file changes into logical units for version control.
        Each group should include:
        - A list of files in the group (relative paths to the project root).
        - A detailed summary of the changes in the group (not the intention, but an overview
        of the actual changes made and why they are related).
        - A suggested branch for the group of changes (either an existing branch or a new one
        with a descriptive name).

        Multiple groups can (and usually should) belong to the same branch.
        Name the branches descriptively, in kebab-case (e.g., `fix-user-login-bug`). Don't use slashes (/).
