/// Perform a three-base merge for each of the parents in `target_merge_commit` which serves as template for the merge.
/// This means that after merging, we will use it unchanged to create a new, possibly signed commit, after adjusting its
/// tree to point to the merge result of its parents.
/// If `target_merge_commit` only has two parents, it will be a normal merge.
///
/// The specialty of the octopus merge is that the merge-base is calculated once using [`gix::Repository::merge_base_octopus()`]
/// and then re-used when merging subsequent `parent-commit^{tree}` into each other in a three-way merge, reusing the previous
/// result as *ours* until all parents are merged in.
///
/// Conflicts will cause the operation to fail, there is no hiding of conflicts as merge commits typically are
/// workspace tips which are implicit in the application. For consistency, there is no special treatment of merge-commits
/// which are part of the branches or stacks.
///
/// ### About Signing
///
/// Merges are special, and we will *not* sign it if it wasn't yet signed. That way workspace commits will naturally
/// remain unsigned.
/// However, if we re-merge a commit that was signed before it's likely a user-commit that should be treated accordingly.
/// Thanks to this logic, the caller shouldn't have to steer signing.
