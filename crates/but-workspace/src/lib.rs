//! ### Terminology
//!
//! * **Workspace**
//!   - A GitButler concept of the combination of one or more branches into one worktree. This allows
//!     multiple branches to be perceived in one worktree, by merging multiple branches together.
//!   - Currently, there is only one workspace per repository, but this is something we intend to change
//!     in the future to facilitate new use cases.
//! * **Workspace Ref**
//!   - The reference that points to the merge-commit which integrates all *workspace* *stacks*.
//! * **Stack**
//!   - GitButler implements the concept of a branch stack. This is essentially a collection of "heads"
//!     (pseudo branches) that contain each other.
//!   - Always contains at least one branch.
//!   - High level documentation here: <https://docs.gitbutler.com/features/stacked-branches>
//! * **Target Branch**
//!   - The branch every stack in the workspace wants to get merged into.
//!   - It's usually a local tracking branch, but doesn't have to if no Git *remote* is associated with it.
//!   - Git doesn't have a notion of such a branch.
//! * **DiffSpec**
//!   - A type that identifies changes, either as whole file, or as hunks in the file.
//!   - It doesn't specify if the change is in a commit, or in the worktree, so that information must provided separately.
