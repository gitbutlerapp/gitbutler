//! ### Terminology
//!
//! * **Workspace**
//!     - A GitButler concept of the combination of one or more branches into one worktree. This allows
//!       multiple branches to be perceived in one worktree, by merging multiple branches together.
//!     - Currently, there is only one workspace per repository, but this is something we intend to change
//!       in the future to facilitate new use cases.
