//! ### Terminology
//!
//! * **Workspace**
//!     - A GitButler concept of the combination of one or more branches into one worktree. This allows
//!       multiple branches to be perceived in one worktree, by merging multiple branches together.
//!     - Currently, there is only one workspace per repository, but this is something we intend to change
//!       in the future to facilitate new use cases.
//!
//! * **Stack**
//!   - GitButler implements the concept of a branch stack. This is essentially a collection of "heads"
//!     (pseudo branches) that contain each other.
//!   - Always contains at least one branch.
//!   - High level documentation here: <https://docs.gitbutler.com/features/stacked-branches>
//!
