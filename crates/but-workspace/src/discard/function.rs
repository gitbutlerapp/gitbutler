/// Discard the given `changes` in the worktree of `repo`. If a change could not be matched with an actual worktree change, for
/// instance due to a race, that's not an error, instead it will be returned in the result Vec, along with all hunks that couldn't
/// be matched.
/// The returned Vec is typically empty, meaning that all `changes` could be discarded.
///
/// `context_lines` is the amount of context lines we should assume when obtaining hunks of worktree changes to match against
/// the ones we have specified in the hunks contained within `changes`.
///
/// Discarding a change is really more of an 'undo' of a change as it will restore the previous state to the desired extent - Git
/// doesn't have a notion of this on a whole-file basis.
///
/// Each of the `changes` will be matched against actual worktree changes to make this operation as safe as possible, after all, it
/// discards changes without recovery.
///
/// In practice, this is like a selective 'inverse-checkout', as such it must have a lot of the capabilities of checkout, but focussed
/// on just a couple of paths, and with special handling for renamed files, something that `checkout` can't naturally handle
/// as it's only dealing with single file-paths.
///
/// ### Hunk-based discarding
///
/// When an instance in `changes` contains hunks, these are the hunks to be discarded. If they match a whole hunk in the worktree changes,
/// it will be discarded entirely, simply by not applying it.
///
/// ### Sub-Hunk discarding
///
/// It's possible to specify ranges of hunks to discard. To do that, they need an *anchor*. The *anchor* is the pair of
/// `(line_number, line_count)` that should not be changed, paired with the *other* pair with the new `(line_number, line_count)`
/// to discard.
///
/// For instance, when there is a single patch `-1,10 +1,10` and we want to bring back the removed 5th line *and* the added 5th line,
/// we'd specify *just* two selections, one in the old via `-5,1 +1,10` and one in the new via `-1,10 +5,1`.
/// This works because internally, it will always match the hunks (and sub-hunks) with their respective pairs obtained through a
/// worktree status.
