#![allow(unused_variables)]
//! What follows is a description of all entities we need to implement Workspaces,
//! a set of *two or more* branches that are merged together.
//!
//! ## tl/dr
//!
//! - `Switch` is a way to checkout any branch
//!
//! ## Rules
//!
//! The following rules and values govern how certain operations work. Ideally, everything that is written here can be
//! reproduced by extrapolating them.
//!
//! * `HEAD` always points to a workspace.
//!     - **Implicit Workspace**
//!          - a commit (zero, one or more parents) created by the user, possibly pointed to by a branch.
//!     - **Implicit Workspace with Metadata**
//!          - like above, but has a `gitbutler/workspace/name` ref pointing to it which typically carries *ref-metadata*
//!     - **Workspace with Metadata**
//!          - a *workspace commit* with `gitbutler/workspace/name` reference pointing to it.
//!          - always has two or more parents, otherwise it has no reason to exist.
//! * _Optional_ *Target branches* are implied, globally explicit or don't exist at all
//!     - If they exist, allow computing the highest/most-recent *target merge-base* that *stacks* in the
//!       *workspace* are forked-off from.
//!     - The *target merge-base* informs about how many commits we are behind *or* ahead.
//!     - The whole workspace can be made to include more recent (or older) versions of the *target branch*
//!     - A *target branch* is typically initialized from the remote tracking branch of the current branch at `HEAD`.
//!     - Alternatively it's configured for the whole project.
//!  * *Target merge bases* _should_ not change implicitly
//!     - This merge-base is the 'view of the world' for the user as it's the *most recent merge-base with the target branch available in the worktree*.
//!       Hence, it should remain stable.
//!     - Adding branches to the workspace with *their* *target merge base* in our *past* is OK.
//!     - Adding branches to the workspace with *their* *target merge base* in our *future* is not OK
//!       unless the user allows it, or…
//!        - We may try to *rebase* branches from the future onto our *target merge base*
//!          if they have no remote tracking branch.
//!  * *Workspace Merge Base*
//!     - Is automatically the *Target Merge Base* if there is just a single branch.
//!     - Is the octopus merge-base between all stacks in a workspace, i.e. a commit reachable from the tips of all stacks.
//!  * *Remote Tracking Branches* are considered to integrate stacks with
//!     - The *Target branch* can be the remote tracking branch of a local tracking branch that is part of the workspace.
//!  * *Stacks* and their commits
//!     - Are listed in such a way that they don't repeat across multiple stacks, i.e. only commits that aren't in
//!      any of the other stacks or in the target branch (if present).
//!  * *Stack Segment* - a set of connected commits between reference name and another reference name, or the lower bound of the stack.
//!
//! TODO:
//!  - sketch for detached HEAD, unapply last branch. Then applying another branch checks that out.
//!  - unapplying everything with target should go to the tip of target
//!  - how about a workspace that has a shared commit so assignment isn't clear
//!  - About reference points for rev-walks (WMB, TMB, auto-target when branch has PR with target to merge into)
//!    Without reference points, walks will be indefinite.
//!  - What happens if the user points to a merge commit? Can they use GitButler to more easily see what's going on?
//!
//! ## Operations
//!
//! * **add branch from workspace**
//!    - Add a branch to a *workspace commit* so it also includes the tip of the branch.
//! * **remove branch from workspace**
//!    - Remove a branch from a *workspace commit*
//!    - Alternatively, checkout the *target branch*
//! * **switch**
//!    - Switch between branches of any kind, similar to `git switch`, but with automatic worktree stashing.
//! * **stash changes**
//!    - Implicit, causes worktree changes to be raised into their own tree and commit on top of `HEAD`.
//! * **apply stashed changes**
//!    - Lower previously stashed changes by re-applying them to a possibly changed tree, and checking them
//!      out to the working tree.
//!
//! ## Metadata
//!
//! Metadata is all data that doesn't refer to Git objects (i.e. anything with a SHA1), and can be associated with
//! a full reference name.
//!
//! ## Target Branch
//!
//! The branch that every branch in a workspace wants to get integrated with,
//! either by merging or by being rebased onto it.
//!
//! The target branch is always a *remote tracking branch*, and as such it's not expected to be checked out
//! nor would it be committed into directly.
//!
//! ## Rebase Considerations
//!
//! We avoid rebasing when adding something to the workspace,
//! either because the added stack as a remote tracking branch, or because its merge-base with the target branch
//! is in the past.
//!
//! If we were to *rebase* as part of a workspace update or adding to the stack, we would have to try to assure that the user isn't
//! *accidentally pushing auto-resolved conflicting commits* that this might generate.
//!
//! This could be achieved by temporarily removing branch remote configuration (literally), so it can
//! be put back once it's safe to push. Alternatively, and additionally, the ref could just be put back to
//! its previous location.
//!
//! Alternatively, auto-resolves could be deactivated if we are in Git mode, and instead they are applied
//! to the worktree directly, and we wait (with sequencer support) until the conflict has been resolved.
//!
//! ## Workspace Tip
//!
//! This is the elaborate name of the commit that currently represents what's visible in the working tree,
//! i.e. the commit that `HEAD` points to.
//!
//! `HEAD` can point to Git commits, and to *Workspace Commits*, and the user switches `HEAD` locations
//! at will with any tool of choice.
//!
//! ## Workspace Commits
//!
//! Whenever there are more than one branch to show, a *workspace commit* is created to keep track of the branches
//! that are contained in it, making it *always a merge commit*.
//!
//! ### Workspace References
//!
//! Whenever a workspace is officially created by means of a *workspace commit*, a `refs/heads/gitbutler/workspace/<name>`
//! is also created to point to it.
//! These are removed once the corresponding *workspace commit* is going out of scope and if they don't contain any
//! ref-metadata worth holding on to.
//!
//! *This also makes workspaces enumerable*.
//!
//! ## Worktree Stashes via Stash Commits
//!
//! Whenever there are worktree changes present before switching `HEAD` to another location,
//! we will leave them if they don't interfere with the new `HEAD^{tree}` that we are about switch to, as a `safe` checkout
//! is assumed.
//! Those that *do interfere* we pick up and place as special *stash commit* on top of the commit
//! that can accommodate them and let a *stash reference* point to it.
//!
//! ### Stash References
//!
//! The *stash reference* is created in the *gitbutler-stashes* [Git namespace](gix::refs::file::Store::namespace) to
//! fully isolate them from the original reference name. This also means that we should disallow renaming branches with
//! an associated *stash reference* and make it possible to list orphaned stashes as well, along with recovery options.
//!
//! For instance, if a references is `refs/heads/gitbutler/workspace/one`, then the stash reference is in
//! `<namespace: gitbutler-stashes>/refs/heads/gitbutler/workspace/one`. The reason for this is that they will not
//! be garbage-collected that way.
//! Note that any ref, like `refs/heads/feature` can carry a stash, so *workspace references* aren't special.
//!
//! *This also makes stashes enumerable*. It's notable that it's entirely possible for stashes to become *orphaned*,
//! i.e. their workspace commit (that the stash commit sits on top of) doesn't have a reference *with the same name*
//! pointing to it anymore. What's great is that these can easily be recovered, along with the stash
//! as it's trivial to find the *workspace commit* as only parent of the *stash commit*.
//!
//! They can also be *desynced*, meaning that the parent reference doesn't point to the parent of the *stash commit* anymore.
//!
//! ### Raising a Stash
//!
//! This is the process of knowing what to put in a stash in the first place before changing the worktree.
//! The idea is to *minimize* the stash and leave everything that isn't going to be touched by the final checkout in place.
//! That way what's in the stash is only the files that need to be merged back, minimizing the chance for conflicts.
//!
//! ### Apply Stashed Changes/Lowering a Stash
//!
//! Stashed changes are cherry-picked onto the target tree, but *merge conflicts* have to be kept and checked out
//! to manifest them, similar to what happens when a Git stash is popped.
//!
//! If the destination of an unapply operation already has a stash, both source and destination stash will be merged
//! with merge-conflicts manifesting in the tree.
//!
//! ### Shortcomings
//!
//! * **changed indices prevent stash creation**
//!     - If changes in the .git/index would be ignored, data stored only there would be lost.
//!     - conflicts would be lost, and should probably prevent the stash in any case.
//! * **complexities with multiple worktree stashes**
//!     - The user can leave a stash in each worktree that they switch away from.
//!     - When switching back to a commit with stash we now have to deal with two stashes, the one that was already
//!       there and the one we newly created before switching. Depending on the operation we may have to merge both
//!       stashes, which can conflict.
