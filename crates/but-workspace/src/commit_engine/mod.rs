/// to discard.
///

/// we'd specify *just* two selections, one in the old via `-5,1 +1,10` and one in the new via `-1,10 +5,1`.
/// This works because internally, it will always match the hunks (and sub-hunks) with their respective pairs obtained through a
/// worktree status, using the anchor, and apply an additional processing step to get the actual old/new hunk pairs to use when
/// building the buffer to commit.
