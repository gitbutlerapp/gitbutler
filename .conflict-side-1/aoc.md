## What is GitButler?

GitButler is a Git client that is pretty cool, if you ask us.

It is a desktop application that you can use to manage your Git branches.
It has:

- virtual branches to easily deal with independent features simultaneously
- stacked branches to work with dependent features
- simple drag and drop for reordering, amending and squashing commits
- AI powered commit message and PR description generation
- and much more

Check out how cool it looks:

See you on the leaderboards, and happy coding!
