GitButler is a [Fair Source software project](https://blog.gitbutler.com/gitbutler-is-now-fair-source/), built on a vast foundation of open source software. We're committed to giving back to the community and supporting the projects that we rely on.

As part of our commitment to open source, we are an early member of the [Open Source Pledge](https://osspledge.com/). We have pledged to give back to the open source community by donating $2000 per year per full time software developer that we employ to the OSS projects and maintainers that we depend on.

You can read more about our reasoning to join the OSS Pledge in our announcement blog post and 2024 report: [GitButler Joins the Open Source Pledge](https://blog.gitbutler.com/open-source-pledge-2024).
