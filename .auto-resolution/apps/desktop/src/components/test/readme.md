# Confirming behavior around TS/Svelte

It's often excessive to test functionality of a language, framework, or library,
but in cases where documentation is lacking or is poorly defined, it can be
reasonable to ensure that assumptions do indeed hold.

Test cases defined here likely should be upstreamed to define the behaviors
perminently.
