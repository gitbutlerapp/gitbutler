/**
 * Converts an async subscriber contract to one that can be consumed syncronusly
 * in something like an `$effect`.
 *
 * This function ensures eventual consistency with the state of the effect.
 *
 * It also ensures that a subscribe call is always followed by an unsubscribe,
 * and vise versa. As such, we can garuntee that the subscription counter
 * contained in the async fn is consistent.
 *
 * To manage this, track some important states:
 * - `inUse` tracks the state that the sync world wants us to be in.
 * - `subscribed` tracks whether we are actually subscribed or not.
 * - `working` tracks whether we are currently transitioning from subscribed
 *   to unsubscribed, or vise versa.
 *
 * Whenever the sync world signals a state change, we call an internal
 * `resolveState` function, which checks to see if we're already changing states
 * and if so, simply does nothing. It also checks to see if we're already in
 * the desired state, and also will do nothing.
 *
 * We also call `resolveState` after we have finished either subscribing or
 * unsubscribing which allows us to catch up on any state changes that may of
 * happened while that subscribe or unsubscribe was still happening.
