In our design system, we use different types of colors.
The first group is the Core colors.

## Core colors

Core colors doesn't have any specific meaning or themes. They are just color ranges that used in the next color groups.
It's better to avoid using core colors directly in the app. Use color `Scale` colors instead.

<iframe
	style={{
		border: '1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)'
	}}
	width="100%"
	height="500"
	src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fdesign%2FJir22AjzvPokdbMbe8yt5k%2F%25F0%259F%2592%258E-Core%3Fnode-id%3D404-4319%26t%3Dd8WJEYZK76vUHeB6-1"

Core colors still have some useage areas.
All colors in the app could be breaked down to 4 areas â€” from the very light to the very dark:

- **Background colors** â€” colors that are used for backgrounds on large areas - like pages, modals, containers, etc.
- **Soft colors** â€” colors a bit darker and suitable for smaller elements like buttons, inputs, borders, etc.
- **Solid colors** â€” these colors are strong and dark. It's suitable small elements that should be highlighted - like error buttons, borders, alerts, etc.
- **Text colors** â€” these colors are dark and therefore suitable for text.

<iframe
	style={{
		border: '1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)'
	}}
	width="100%"
	height="700"

All colors in the app could be also split into 6 color groups:

- **Ntrl colors** â€” neutral colors. These colors are used for backgrounds, text, and other elements that should not be highlighted.
- **Pop colors** â€” this color used to highlight elements.

- **Err colors** â€” error colors â€” a service group.
- **Warn colors** â€” warning colors â€” a service group.
- **Succ colors** â€” success colors - a service group.

- **Purp colors** â€” info colors.

## Scale colors

Scale colors also doesn't have any specific meaning, but they have themes.

This is how you use scale colors:

```css
/* Use scale colors */
background-color: var(--clr-scale-ntrl-10);
color: var(--clr-scale-pop-90);
```

<iframe
	style={{
		border: '1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)'
	}}
	width="100%"
	height="500"
	src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fdesign%2FJir22AjzvPokdbMbe8yt5k%2F%25F0%259F%2592%258E-Core%3Fnode-id%3D3835-268%26t%3Dd8WJEYZK76vUHeB6-1"
	allowFullScreen
