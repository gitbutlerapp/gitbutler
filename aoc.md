## What is GitButler?

GitButler is a Git GUI that is pretty cool, if you ask us.

It is a desktop application that you can use to manage your Git branches.
We have:

- virtual branches to easily deal with independent features simultaneously
- stacked branches to work with dependent features
- simple drag and drop rebasing tools
- AI powered commit message and PR description generation
- and much more

Check out how cool it looks:
