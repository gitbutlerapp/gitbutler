/**
 * The fingerprint shape is `["ipc", <command>, <normalised-first-line>]`.
 * These tests anchor the normaliser so a regex tweak that accidentally
 * un-strips a per-user identifier (paths, branch names, SHAs) fails CI
 * before it ships and silently re-broadens Sentry buckets.
 *
 * Identifiers in the sample messages below (file paths, branch names,
 * SHAs, UUIDs) are synthetic placeholders chosen to exercise the
 * relevant rule; they are not taken from any specific production event.
