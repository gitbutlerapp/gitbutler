## Overview

GitButler is a new Source Code Management system designed to manage your branches, record and backup your work, be your Git client, help with your code and much more. Our focus is everything after writing code in your editor and before sharing it on GitHub. We're focused on your working directory and how we can help with everything you do there.

## What We Do

The GitButler client is a powerful Git client. You can manage your branches, work on multiple things at once, push and fetch from your Git server, easily rebase and modify commits and more. We have a unique approach to merge conflicts that help split up any conflicting work. It also keeps a timeline so that you can easily undo any operation.
