Thinking about paying for Beta software? Sounds odd, right?

No worries, the main stuff in GitButler stays the same whether you pay or not.

But hey, we're all about building a cool gang here. We want to know who really digs our butler. And those early supporters? They're like VIPs to us.

## Perks for Early Supporters

- Access to our Early Bird Discord room, for life
- Invitations to exclusive Berlin parties, when it's warm here
- Care packages of schwag, sent your way
- Pricing locked in, no matter how we decide to charge later
- First look at any new features as we go
- Whatever else we can think of over time

Your support helps us grow and make GitButler even better. Join us on this adventure!
