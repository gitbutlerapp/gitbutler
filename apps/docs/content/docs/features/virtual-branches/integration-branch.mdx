Bundling all your virtual branches together

Since GitButler does some pretty fun stuff with branches in order to enable virtual branches to work, some Git commands run from other git clients, including stock Git in the terminal are bound to behave a little strangely.

We're getting the git data to think in three dimensions, then asking 2-D Git how to deal with it.

While some commands cannot work well because of this single-branch limitation (commit, checkout), we do try our best to keep everything in a state where most other commands work reasonably well. Anything having to do with the index or HEAD is a little problematic, but doable in a smooshed state (all branches look like one), while commands like `log` or `blame` work totally fine with no shenanigans.

## The Integration Commit
The way that we handle this relatively well is by creating an "integration" commit every time you change the committed state of your collective virtual branches.

So what is an "integration" commit? Well, when you apply or unapply branches, or you commit on one of your applied branches, you change the state of what GitButler sees as your overall committed state with regards to your working directory.

## Status, Diff and Log

To keep Git command output for things that look at the index and HEAD (such as `status` or `diff`) somewhat sane, we modify your index to look like the union of all the committed states of all your applied virtual branches. This makes `git diff` and `git status` behave more or less like you would expect.

For instance, if you have two files on Branch A and two files on Branch B, then `git status` will simply list four files as modified.

However, to help out, we also write out a branch with a custom commit message that tries to explain the state of things and what is happening. This is written to a branch we own called `gitbutler/workspace` and you shouldn't touch it.

If you run `git log`, the first commit should be our custom commit message and the tree of that commit is the union of all the committed work on all your applied virtual branches, as though they were all merged together into one (something stock Git can understand).

## Committing, Branching, Checking Out

However, if you try to use something that writes to HEAD, like `git commit` or `git checkout`, then you might have some headaches. By default, our client will simply overwrite the `gitbutler/workspace` branch commit whenever something significant changes.

We won't touch the working directory in an unexpected way, so whatever you commit won't be lost, but the commit itself will be forgotten. Don't do branch stuff in stock Git while trying to use GitButler for now. We have ideas on how to make this somewhat doable in the future, but right now it's easier on everyone to stick with one or the other.

## Git Add and the Index

If you attempt to modify the index directly (running `git add` or `git rm`), GitButler won't notice or care. It will simply overwrite it with whatever it needs during its operations, so while I wouldn't do it, there is also not a lot of danger.

The worst that would happen is that you do some complex `git add -i` patch staging and then we wipe it out by rewriting the index. But again, you shouldn't be using stock Git commands related to committing or branching. You gotta choose one or the other for now, you can't go back and forth super easily.

## Recovering or Stopping GitButler Usage

If you want to stop using GitButler and go back to using stock Git commands for committing and branching, simply check out another branch. GitButler will realize that you've changed its branch and stop functioning until you reset it.

To help with remembering where you were, the integration commit should have the branch name and commit SHA that you were on when GitButler was initially activated. You should be able to easily go back to that branch and its last known commit state.
