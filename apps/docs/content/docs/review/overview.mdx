# Butler Review

Butler Review is a new approach to code review that focuses on reviewing code
as a series of evolving patches rather than a unified diff of a whole branch.

## Why Butler Review?

Traditional code review tools like GitHub and GitLab show changes as a single
diff of the entire branch. This makes it hard to review changes in a branch
incrementally, especially when the branch is large. It also discourages creating
good commit or commit messages, since they are all sqaushed in review and
messages are difficult to find and unrelated to the code review UI.

Butler Review approaches the problem differently, by making it easy to review
individual commits as patches and tracking changes to the series when you rebase
or amend the branch.

This makes it easier to review changes incrementally and evolve a series rather
than pushing poor commits to the branch to address feedback.

## Enabling Butler Review

To start using Butler Reviews, you need to enable the feature in your GitButler
client in the project settings. Click the gear icon in the bottom left corner of
the GitButler client and go to the Server tab.

Once you enable Butler Review, you can start creating reviews for your branches.

## Creating a Review

Once you have enabled Butler Review for a project, you can create a review for
a branch by clicking the new "Create Butler Review" button in the branch header card.

  subtitle="Creating a Butler Review"
/>

Once you create a review, you will see a new card in the branch header that
shows the status of the review.

If you have GitHub integration enabled, you will see a dropdown to let you choose
to create a PR or a Butler Review. You can also create both, in either order and
they will be linked together.

Once a Review has been opened, you will have a URL that you can share with your
team to get feedback on your changes.

## Reviewing a Series

When a reviewer opens a review, they will see a list of patches that make up the branch.

<ImageSection
  alt="Butler Review"
  src="/review/branch.png"
  subtitle="A patch series in Butler Review"
/>

<Callout type="warn">
  Currently, all reviews are "unlisted", meaning that anyone with the URL can see the review.
  In the future, we will implement fully public and fully private reviews, but currently all reviews
  are unlisted.

However, if someone has the URL, they will only be able to see the patch data,
they will not have access to all of your source code, nor will they be able to make changes,
only approve or request changes.

</Callout>

Now the reviewer can hit "Start Review" to start reviewing the patches in the series.
It will start them at the "bottom", the first patch and they can work their way up.
The reviewer can also click on a patch to go directly to it.

## Reviewing a Patch

Once a reviewer starts reviewing a patch, they will see the changes in the commit
and a chat window to leave comments.

<ImageSection alt="Reviewing a Patch" src="/review/patch2.png" subtitle="Reviewing a Patch" />

The reviewer can leave comments on the patch, approve the patch, or request changes.
The chat discussion is real time, so reviewers can discuss the changes with the author
as they review the patch.

You can also select lines of code to comment on. This will highlight the line in the
diff and show the comment in the chat window.

Every patch needs to be approved before the branch is considered approved.

## Requesting Changes

A reviewer can either approve a patch or request changes. If they request changes,
the author can amend that specific commit and publish the changes to the review.

Reviewers will be able to see in the chat that a new version of the patch has been
published and they can review the changes again.

<Callout>
  Currently we don't have interdiffs, so reviewers will need to review the entire patch again. We
  plan to add interdiffs in the very near future.
</Callout>

## Approving a Patch

Once a reviewer is happy with a patch, they can approve it. This will mark the patch
as approved and move the reviewer to the next patch in the series.

## Closing a Review

Once the branch has been merged, it will automatically mark the review as closed.
The author can also manually close the review if they decide to abandon the series.
